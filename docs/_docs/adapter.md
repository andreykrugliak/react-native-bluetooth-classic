Adapter related API functions are generally only available on **Android**.  This is due to the MFi rules on IOS and the fact that the [External Accessory](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/externalaccessory) framework is pretty locked down.   I've found some examples of using [Core Bluetooth](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth) to access some **Bluetooth Classic** features - if it's possible I'll try to get those implemented.
